# load, code & save images
Calling an image from a location, doing basic tasks & saving the image as an output file.

This code is tested on Spyder 4.0.1
Issue: cannot run specific block of code. while pressing CTRL+ENTER the entire code is executed & the following error is generated.

````
error: OpenCV(4.1.2) /io/opencv/modules/highgui/src/window.cpp:376: error: (-215:Assertion failed) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function 'imshow'
````

The same loadcode.py runs smoothly by hitting F5 (running the entire code block)

If you find any clue, please let me know.
